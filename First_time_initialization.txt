picow esp32 s3 board
we want to use Arduino for programming picow.
first go to: https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-Centi-S3/Arduino/Environment   or Or select BPI-Leaf-S3 board from Tools > Board menu, its default settings can be used directly.
then by following the instructions you need to install.
Now you need to go to TOOL>Board>Board manager  in textbox write Espressif then for version select 3.0.0 there is a problem with version 3.0.2 then select install.

for first example: https://bpi-steam.com/PicoW_S3_doc/en/Arduino/Basic.html 
in this page there are some project to test and if your board has a bootloader the instructions in this page will help you to load your program.

Good luck
